This dashboard showcases a variety of visualization types, including bar charts,area charts, and KPIs, providing comprehensive insights into the performance of the Sample Superstore. By incorporating a dynamic parameter for the year, I can easily analyze data for different years and identify trends and patterns over time.

One of the standout features of this dashboard is the interactive filled map chart in Dashboard 2. By clicking on individual states, a hyperlink action is triggered, providing detailed information about that specific state. This interactive capability allows for in-depth analysis and helps uncover valuable insights.

I would greatly appreciate your valuable comments and advice on this dashboard. Your feedback is incredibly valuable to me as I strive to improve my visualization skills and make future dashboards even more impactful. Please share any suggestions, insights, or areas for improvement that you may have. Let's connect on LinkedIn to discuss further!
